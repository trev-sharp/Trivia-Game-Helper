# Trvia-Game-Helper
A Trivia Game Helper Made To Find The Best Answer To A Given Question (Multi-Language Support)

Uses A Command Line As It's UI, Fairly Straight Foward Program. Uses A HTML Google Search & HTML Yahoo Search Scrapper To Find The Best Answer To A Question. Was Made Originally For The Mobile App 'HQ Trvia'. Developed Its Algrithms For Weeks, Perfecting Its Accuracy. Added Support For 5 Languages - English, Spanish, German, French, Dutch. Stopped Develpoing It After I Lost Interest, But I Feel Like This Program Could Have Potential For Other Programmers.
